	'Young Italy and Young Europe were formed by Giuseppe Mazzini',
	'EXPLANATION:',
	"Mazzini organized a political society known as Young Italy at Marseilles in the year 1831. It was a secret society established to encourage Italian unification and to reinforce the nationalism spirit. Mazzini regarded that a widespread uprising would build a unified Italy, and would provoke a 'European-wide revolutionary crusade'. Young Italy’s motto was God and the People, and its fundamental principle was the union of the numerous kingdoms and states into a single republic as the true underpinning of Italian liberty. In the year 1834, on the model of the Young Italy, 'Mazzini' started 'Young Europe in Berne', Switzerland, to promote the rise of nationalism throughout Europe too. With the establishment of Young Europe, Mazzini demarcated the unique political and social doctrine related to his name. On the basis of his personal view of the role of religion in public and private life, he called on individuals to consider the accomplishment of civic duties as a social responsibility, dedicate themselves to a world of equal and free nationalities, and work for the accomplishment of social justice across class and national lines. Young Europe was aimed to encourage this project by way of education, revolution, and propaganda.",
